# SafeLink – AI-Powered Public Safety Platform for Sri Lanka 🇱🇰

## Project Overview

**SafeLink** is an AI-powered, multilingual mobile platform designed to enhance public safety and community policing in Sri Lanka. The system addresses critical gaps in existing emergency response and policing solutions by integrating real-time communication, intelligent data analysis, and citizen engagement into a single digital ecosystem.

Traditional SOS and crime-reporting systems often rely on delayed communication, limited context, or manual processing. SafeLink overcomes these limitations by combining **real-time GPS tracking, live audio/video streaming, AI-driven threat detection, automated traffic violation handling, and proactive social media monitoring**. The platform enables law enforcement agencies to respond faster, prioritize critical cases, and make data-driven decisions while empowering citizens to actively participate in community safety.

The solution is designed specifically for the Sri Lankan context, supporting **Sinhala and English**, localized datasets, and region-specific public safety challenges.

## 3. Real-Time AI System for Detecting Harmful Social Media Content (FERNANDO P K S - IT22329660)

### Overview
This component uses AI to automatically detect harmful social media content such as harassment, hate speech, abuse, and violent threats. It supports both Sinhala and English, including mixed-language text commonly used in Sri Lanka. The system categorizes harmful messages, displays results with confidence levels on a monitoring dashboard, and helps authorities respond quickly to high-risk content, improving online safety and monitoring efficiency.

1. Public social media content is continuously fetched.
2. Keyword-based pre-filtering selects candidate content.
3. Text, video, and audio are analyzed in parallel.
4. Speech is transcribed and passed to NLP models.
5. Multi-modal predictions are fused into a final decision.
6. High-confidence harmful content triggers alerts.
7. Authorities receive real-time notifications.
8. Confirmed cases are used for continuous model improvement.

### Technologies Used
- Social media APIs - Collect real-time posts, comments, videos, and audio from social media platforms for monitoring.
- YOLOv11 (video action detection) - Detects violent or harmful actions from video content in real time.
- Video processing pipelines - Extract and manage video frames and streams for efficient analysis.
- Whisper / Wav2Vec2 - Convert speech from videos or audio into text for further harmful content analysis.
- BERT / RoBERTa / XLM-R - Analyze text to classify harassment, hate speech, abuse, and violent threats.
